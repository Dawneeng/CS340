Module 8: Journal

•	I feel the way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to ensure that the naming conventions are consistent.  Spacing and indentation are also important, especially with Python on one's code will not run.  When working through an issue, it is best to work down from the more complex tasks to smaller functions to improve maintainability and be adaptable.
It is also important to use meaningful comments which explain the purpose of the classes, functions, and logic behind them.  One should also provide documentation that outlines how to utilize the code and its functionalities.

•	Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
This CRUD module could be reused in future projects which would save development time and effort. My work on the CRUD Python module provided a standardized way to perform different CRUD operations on different collections and database tables.

•	As a Computer Scientist I approach a problem by first trying to understand the problem at hand. Computer Scientists are problem solvers.  It’s important to have a clear understanding of the requirements, constraints, and objectives.  From there, I can design a solution based on the client’s desired goal.  With a goal in mind, I can plan the structure of the solution, then order it from smaller more manageable tasks. I think it's important to ask for peer review when one is stuck or wants alternative views to that of your own which one might grow from.  It is important to always be adaptable and willing to change something if one realizes there may be a fault in what they are doing.
 When approaching a project, I think it is also important to be aware of the software and programs that would be most useful for the project at hand.  For the database that I created, MongoDB and Python were very efficient, and with all the resources and tools to help, I was able to figure out how to navigate certain issues.
 
• Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I approached the Grazioso Salvare by trying to understand their specific needs and goals.  I used that to design the schema that would be fitting, implemented the CRUD functionality, and connected that to the dashboard interface.
•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do its work better?
Computer Scientists are often problem solvers.  They help gather information to thoroughly understand a client's requirements and help them reach their goals.  For this project, I was able to create a dashboard that pulled up specific rescues that the client was interested in.  Utilized a geo-map in order to pinpoint where certain rescues were located.
